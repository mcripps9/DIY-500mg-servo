# Fusion3D
Slightly reworked Fusion360 files and STL files for servo parts.

The worm gear was regenerated using the HelicalGearPlus Fusion360 plug-in.

These settings match the original from maulionc pretty well:

Type: External Gear
Module 0.20 mm
Helix Angle 85.0 deg
Teeth 1
Gear width 3.0mm
3
Advanced:
Standard Normal
Pressure angle: 20 deg
Backlash 1.0mm
Addendum 1.6
Dedendum 0.65

For a deeper tooth profile that worked better, I used these settings:
Backlash 0
Addendum 1.7
Dedendum 1.25
