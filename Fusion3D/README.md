# Fusion3D
Slightly reworked Fusion360 files and STL files for servo parts.

## Fusion360 Files
* Cybermike_500mg-Servo_assembly - An exported Fusion360 archive file containing the original parts as well as my modifications.  The most interesting components are:
  * Cybermike MotorSupport:1 - this is where most of the changes are
  * Regenerated worm gear - deeper teeth:1 - this is the regenerated worm gear with deeper cut teeth

## PC Board Files
- EAGLE - Modified PCB files for (hopefully) easier soldering

## STL Files
- Base - Base and top plate files
- Worm - Regenerated worm gear that seems to mate better with certain resins
- Gears - Spur and output gears with different bore sizes
- ProgrammingAdapter - a 3D printable programming adapter using spring loaded pogo pins that mate with the modified PCBs
