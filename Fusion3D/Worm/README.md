# Worm
Worm gear STL files with deeper teeth and different sized bores.  These
are generated with a deeper tooth profile to make up for the slightly
thicker Siraya Tech Mecha and Elegoo White water washable resin print.

I recommend printing the worm gear at 0.25um (or smaller) layer height for best detail.

The Worm_Set.* files contain 3 sets of all 10 bore sizes for calibrating
against your printer.

The .pwma files are my slice for an Anycubic Photon Mono 4K with Elegoo white
water washable resin and Siraya Tech Mecha at a 0.025mm layer height.

The worm gear was regenerated using the HelicalGearPlus Fusion360 plug-in.

These settings match the original from maulionc pretty well:

Setting         | Value
-------         | -----
Type            | External Gear
Module          | 0.20 mm
Helix Angle     | 85.0 deg
Teeth           | 1
Gear width      | 3.0mm
Standard Normal |
Pressure angle  | 20 deg
Backlash        | 1.0mm
Addendum        | 1.6
Dedendum        | 0.65

For a deeper tooth profile that worked better, I used these settings:
Setting         | Value
-------         | -----
Backlash        | 0mm
Addendum        | 1.7
Dedendum        | 1.25
