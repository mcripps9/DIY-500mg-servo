# Worm
Worm gear STL files with deeper teeth and different sized bores.  These
are generated with a deeper tooth profile to amek up for the slightly
thicker Elegoo White water washable resin print.

The Worm_Set.* files contain 3 sets of all 10 bore sizes for calibrating
against your printer.

The .pwma file is my slice for an Anycubic Photon Mono 4K with Elegoo white
water washable resin at a 0.025mm layer height.
